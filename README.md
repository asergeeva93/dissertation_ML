Title: Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep CNN with Transfer Learning: A Cross-Cultural Application

Abstract: Accurately identifying emotions across cultures remains a persistent challenge for machine learning models. Variations in the intensity of emotional displays highlight the need to better understand the strengths and limitations of these models, particularly in comparison with human perception. This project trained a VGG16-based model using a multicultural dataset (AffectNet) and tested it on American (DISFA) and European (PEDFE, FAMED, WSEFEP) datasets to evaluate whether it could identify previously suggested cultural differences in facial emotion expression. Transfer learning was applied using weights pre-trained on FER13. Results showed that the model predicted higher emotion intensities for the American dataset compared to the multicultural dataset in all categories except fear, and higher intensities than the Italian dataset across all categories. The Polish and UK datasets exhibited the highest predicted intensities, likely reflecting posed rather than spontaneous expressions. The findings carry implications for applications in teaching, healthcare, and research industries.
